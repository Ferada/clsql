Note from Russ Tyndall <russ@acceleration.net> 2012-09-04 :

This is the current results of running the test suite against all the database
backends I have accessible, on SBCL / UBUNTU64bit.  It would be great to
continue improving the test suite and skip tests that reliably fail, improve
tests so that all pass.  In the interim, I would like know that I am not
increasing the number of failing

   :OODML/SELECT/13, :OODML/SELECT/12, :FDML/SELECT/36, 
   :FDDL/CACHE-TABLE-QUERIES/1.

Most of these seem to have to do with not correctly dispatching AUTO_INCREMENT
or not correctly skipping those tests
